These edits are to run an experiment that adds an offset to UST (ustar) in the calculation
of surface fluxes. For ease of replicability, a namelist.input option is created within
the Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON file named 'ust_offset'. 
Because we are adding a variable, multiple files and portions of the files must be changed, 
edits are followed with "Hrag Najarian edit", so feel free to ctrl+f that string to located
the edits. 
If edits are alterations to previous code, the original code will be commented out.
